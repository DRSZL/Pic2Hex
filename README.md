# Pic2Hex

This program is designed to take any image as input and convert it into 256-bit hexadecimal values. 

It works by decoding the image into its constituent pixel information, then processing these data points to generate a corresponding sequence of hexadecimal values. 
This results in a unique 256-bit hex value for each image processed.
