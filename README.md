# Pic2Hex

Main goal of this small project is to make possible attacking vectors for bitcoin walltes.
(Maybe someone has his pricate key stored in an image ;) )

This program is designed to take any image as input and convert it into 256-bit hexadecimal values. 

It works by decoding the image into its constituent pixel information, then processing these data points to generate a corresponding sequence of hexadecimal values. 
This results in a unique 256-bit hex value for each image processed.
